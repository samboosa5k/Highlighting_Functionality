In other words, if you were debugging and had to read the runtime value of a numeric enum, the value is often opaque - it doesn’t convey any useful meaning on its own (though reverse mapping can often help), string enums allow you to give a meaningful and readable value when your code runs, independent of the name of the enum member itself.';
